   San Francisco-based open science non-profit Manylabs/ San Francisco AQ’s Air Quality Network for San Francisco’s Eastern Neighborhoods, submitted to the California Air Resources Board, is a Supplemental Environmental Project.  We install, maintain, and display information online for air quality monitoring instrumentation to detect particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) and Volatile Organic Compounds. PM 2.5 contributes to pulmonary and cardiovascular illnesses, and VOCs such as benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon tetrachloride inflict various health effects such as headaches, coughing and irregular heartbeat, and pose an incremental cancer risk. This project builds upon an earlier grant, which deployed monitors in the Eastern Neighborhoods, encompassing Bayview-Hunters Point, the Excelsior, Bernal Heights, Visitacion Valley, Portola, Balboa Park, the Dogpatch, and the Tenderloin and Chinatown.
